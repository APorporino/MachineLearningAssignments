Part 1: Comparing convergence speed of different gradient descent algorithms on logistic regression models using a diabetes dataset.

Part 2: Analyze the effectiveness of different pre-processing techniques in a logistic regression model

Built a convolutional neural network based on AlexNet and boostrap aggregation to classify handwritten digit and alphabetical letters (60,000 images for training - half labelled). Obtained 91% accuracy on public portion of the hidden test set.

Reproducing the following paper:
A. Golubeva, B. Neyshabur, and G. Gur-Ari, Are wider nets better given the same number of parameters?, 2021. arXiv: 2010.14495 [cs.LG].
Our results showed that (1) their experiments are reproducible, (2) the claims about the MLP model can generalize to a new dataset, and (3) the claims do not generalize well on a new model.
